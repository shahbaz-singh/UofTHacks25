# YeetCode - The Next Generation Debugging Platform

![YeetCode Logo](./logo.png)

## Overview

Welcome to **YeetCode**, a revolutionary platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional algorithmic assessments and real-world software engineering skills. 

The tech industry has long relied on data-structure and algorithm-focused interviews, which, while valuable, often overemphasize theoretical knowledge at the expense of practical, job-relevant skills like debugging, problem-solving, and navigating large codebases. This approach not only neglects critical skills but also enables cheating, creating an unfair environment for honest candidates. To compensate, assessments have become increasingly difficult, but this circular strategy ultimately rewards "professional LeetCoders" rather than true software engineers.

YeetCode changes the game by generating large, realistic codebases that simulate real-world scenarios for users to debug, test, and analyze. It provides a cheat-proof, fair way to evaluate problem-solving abilities while emphasizing skills necessary for success in real-world engineering roles. With advanced anti-cheat measures like eye-tracking and tab monitoring, YeetCode ensures the integrity of assessments, creating a level playing field for all participants. The interconnected and multi-file structure of the challenges also makes them inherently resistant to AI-driven shortcuts, ensuring authentic skill evaluation.
